        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>2 tablespoons coconut oil</li>
                <li>500 gram chicken breast halves, cut into small cubes</li>
                <li>1 can coconut cream</li>
                <li>1 bottle red Thai curry sauce</li>
                <li>8 ounce dried rice stick vermicelli noodles</li>
            </ul>
        <h4>Cooking Steps</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Heat oil in a large skillet on high heat. Add chicken cubes; cook until browned, about 2 minutes per side. 
                    Reduce heat to medium-high and add coconut cream and curry sauce. 
                    Cook until chicken is no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 5 minutes. 
                    An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li><p></p>
                <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil; stir in vermicelli pasta and return to a boil. 
                    Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is tender yet firm to the bite, 4 to 5 minutes. Drain.</li><p></p>
                <li>Reduce skillet heat to simmer. Add the noodles and let simmer until flavors are absorbed, about 5 minutes. 
                    Divide chicken and noodles among individual serving bowls.</li><p></p>
            </ol>
