        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is a fantastic light salad, perfect for the dog days of summer. 
           It's gorgeous and delicious! I had it at a wonderful restaurant in Napa, CA and went home to try to duplicate it myself. 
           Have it for lunch or as a beginning to your summer dinner.</p>
